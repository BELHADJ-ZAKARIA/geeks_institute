Exercise 1: What is the Season?

Ask the user to input a month (1 to 12).
Display the season of the month received:

Autumn runs from September (9) to November (11)

Exercise 2: For Loop

Use a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.
Using a for loop, that loops from 1 to 20 (inclusive), print out every element which has an even index.

Exercise 3: While Loop

Write a while loop that will continuously ask the user for their name, unless the input is equal to your name.

Exercise 4: Check the index

Using this variable:

Ask a user for their name, if their name is in the names list print out the index of the first occurrence of the name.
Example: if input is Cortana we should be printing the index 1

Exercise 6: Random number

Ask the user to input a number from 1 to 9 (including).
Get a random number between 1 and 9. Hint: random module.
If the user guesses the correct number print a message that says “Winner”.
If the user guesses the wrong number print a message that says “Better luck next time.”

Bonus: use a loop that allows the user to keep guessing until they want to quit.
Bonus 2: on exiting the loop, tally up and display total games won and lost.
