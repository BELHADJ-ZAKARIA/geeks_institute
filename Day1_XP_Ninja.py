Exercise 3: Working on a paragraph

Find an interesting paragraph of text online. (Please keep it appropriate to the social context of our class.)
Paste it to your code, and store it in a variable.
Let’s analyze the paragraph. Print out a nicely formatted message saying:
* How many characters it contains (this one is easy…).
* How many sentences it contains.
* How many words it contains.
* How many unique words it contains.

Bonus: How many non-whitespace characters it contains.
Bonus: The average amount of words per sentence in the paragraph.
Bonus: the amount of non-unique words in the paragraph.
